# Sample Page with Comments

This page demonstrates Giscus comments integration with mkdocs-material.

## How It Works

When you add `comments: true` to the front matter of any markdown file,
a Giscus comment section appears at the bottom of the page.

Users can:

- Post comments (requires GitHub login)
- React to comments with emoji
- Reply to existing comments in threads
- View discussions directly in your GitHub repository

## Benefits for Intelligent Textbooks

Giscus provides several advantages for educational content:

1. **Student Questions** - Learners can ask clarifying questions directly on the page
2. **Community Knowledge** - Answers become part of the permanent record
3. **Feedback Loop** - Authors see which concepts need better explanation
4. **No Server Required** - Everything runs through GitHub Discussions
5. **Spam Protection** - GitHub authentication prevents anonymous spam
