# About This Feedback and Comment Website

This website is for demonstrating how to add feedback and comments
to every page in an intelligent textbook that uses the mkdocs system
using both Google Analytics as well as the GitHub Giscus system
that allows users to add comments to the Discussion system
within GitHub.

It contains a detailed tutorial as well as instructions on
how to use a Claude Code Skill to automate the automation steps.
