use the skill-creator skill to create a new skill called 'giscus-installer' that will install all the giscus software    
  into an existing intelligent textbook site built with mkdocs.  Put this skill in the folder @skills/giscus-installer.    
  Make sure that there is a well-documented README.md in the skill folder about how to use the skill.
